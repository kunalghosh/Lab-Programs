Here we discuss the approach taken to solve the CRC-CCITT-n bit error
detection code. (Here n is 16)

What we are going to do :
* Given a N bit message, append n bits to the message (here n is 16).
* Get a generator string n+1 bits long ( here n+1 would become 17 bits).
* create a new N+n bit array for storing the Remainder.
* for every bit in the Message (i.e from 0 to N bits of the Message ) do : 

  * Align the generator to the first occuring '1' in the NEW Message 
    * Update the Remainder array with the XOR or generator and Message.
    * Overwrite the bits in the Remainder array if necessary.

* Append the remainder to the Message ( N bits long ).
  * This message is send to the reciever.


AT THE RECIEVER END:
* Get the message appended with the CRC 
* XOR the recieved message with the generator, as above.
* The remainder must be all zeros. INDICATING no errors
  * If the remainder is not all zeros INDICATES ERRORS have occurred.
